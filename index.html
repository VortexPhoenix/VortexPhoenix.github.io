       <p>
          My name is <a href="mailto:Jeremy.Lueders@ptaaschool.net">Jeremy Lueders</a>. I am a student in 11th grade at PTAA 
          and am doing this for computer science class. The thing I like the most about going to school at PTAA is getting to 
          program and learning to code in HTML5. I work at McDonalds and am not loving it, hahaha funny joke, and only work 
          weekends. I have been working there for around 7 months and like taking orders the most.

         I have many hobbies and thing I enjoy. Some of the things I enjoy doing are playing Guitar Hero, programming, driving, 
         and helping others. Some of my hobbies are fishing, streaming on Twitch, playing with my dog, and learning electric 
         guitar. My plans for after school are to become either a police detective or a game programmer, and invent things in 
         my off time for fun. My favorite game is <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny/newlight">Destiny 2</a> and my
         favorite video game character is <a href="https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Cayde-6">Cayde-6</a>.
